this directory is for file based secrets that won't be committed to the repo.

=.env= files should be in the format ~ENV=foobar~ as they'll be used along with docker's =env-file= option which expects that format.

Currently the list of secrets is:
- drone-github-client.env
- drone-github-secret.env
- drone-rpc-secret.env
- drone-user-filter.env

* todo list
** DONE set up an inbound port forward or similar for webhooks for drone
the =DRONE_SERVER_PROXY_HOST= environment variable can be used to specify the hook url it sets up
