This is the config for my drone server. I'm setting this up first because I think if I get drone running I can have it manage the rest of everything just using drone builds, docker-compose, etc. We shall see. Plus it's fun.

Anyways, it seems that drone can only read secrets from environment variables and also docker can't expose secrets directly as environment variables, so you need to do a little dance. Set up a secret, set its value to =ENV_VAR=<the actual secret>=, then use the env-file option to load it. Seems a bit wonky, but there's perhaps a way to do it better using template-driver option? No idea. Going to do it this way to start.
